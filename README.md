## Course Description

This course introduces the student to regression analysis for social science inquiry. We will be working primarily in R.

## Pre-requisites

It is assumed that the student has a basic knowledge of probability, algebra, and inferential statistics, and a cursory knowledge of regression analysis (POSC 20093 or an equivalent should suffice).  

It is also assumed that the student has a basic understanding of R, Stata or SPSS.  Examples in the course will be demonstrated using R, but the student may use the software of their choice to complete their final assignment.

This is NOT an easy course. You have been warned.

## Course Policies
Students are expected to attend class on a regular basis, in a timely manner, and without disruption to other students. Students should be prepared to participate in detailed discussion of the required reading or class activity for that class date.

**Civility Policy:** In accordance with the philosophy of an institution for higher learning, the classroom should be a place where diverse ideas can be explored with respect in order to promote learning and growth. 

We each come from a variety of backgrounds and bring with us different experiences to the classroom. Regardless of whether or not we share similar opinions and beliefs, I expect us to remain respectful of each other as we explore ideas. I encourage you to express yourself with reason, clarity, courtesy, and compassion. This ensures that we may be comfortable learning and growing without fear of judgment, ridicule, or intimidation. I welcome each of you as worthy contributors in the classroom. Student conduct that disrupts the learning process will not be tolerated and may lead to disciplinary action and/or removal from class.

In line with expectations set in the Code of Conduct found in the TCU Student Handbook, the following contradict the ethos of this course and will not be permitted in any form: 

1.	Ad hominem attacks or attacks on an individual’s or group of individuals’ character on the basis of gender, race, class, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, or other personal characteristics. 
2.	Epithets or other language intended to intimidate, demean, or incite violence.
3.	Editorial content that is harmful, threatening, abusive, demeaning, or libelous.

**Technology Policies:** By all means use your laptops and tablets (though study after study shows that handwriting notes is much more effective).  If you are doing things other than taking notes or exercises in R (such as playing games, visiting Facebook, messaging, etc.), you will lose participation points. All cell phones and other electronic devices should be silenced and not used during class. If you plan on recording any portion of the course, you must come meet with me.

**Office Hours & Communications:** I encourage students to take advantage of my office hours in order to ask questions or discuss issues related to the course or political science more generally. If you have any comments about or problems with the course itself, I encourage you to share them in my office hours. E-mail is best for questions requiring short answers not found in the syllabus or to schedule a meeting outside of regular office hours. As a general rule, I try to answer emails within 24 hours of receipt, except on weekends and holidays. 

When sending an email, please include the course code, and write a subject line that corresponds to the topic of your query. All communication outside of class will be sent to your university e-mail account. It is expected that you will regularly check your e-mail.

**Accommodations:** If you wish to receive an accommodation under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) you need to provide documentation from the University’s Coordinator of Services for Students with Disabilities, and you should come see me in the first two weeks of class or as soon as your accommodations are received:
Texas Christian University complies with the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 regarding students with disabilities. Eligible students seeking accommodations should contact the Coordinator of Services for Students with Disabilities in the Center for Academic Services located in Sadler Hall, 11. Accommodations are not retroactive, therefore, students should contact the Coordinator as soon as possible in the term for which they are seeking accommodations. Further information can be obtained from the Center for Academic Services, TCU Box 297710, Fort Worth, TX 76129, or at (817) 257-7486.

**Academic Misconduct Policy:** You are responsible for knowing the content of the Academic Misconduct policy; it will be enforced: Academic Misconduct (Sec. 3.4 from the Student Handbook) – Any act that violates the academic integrity of the institution is considered academic misconduct. The procedures used to resolve suspected acts of academic misconduct are available in the offices of Academic Deans and the Office of Campus Life and are listed in detail in the Undergraduate Catalog (Student Policies>Academic Conduct Policy Details; http://catalog.tcu.edu/undergraduate/). Specific examples include, but are not limited to: 

1.	Cheating: Copying from another student’s test paper, laboratory report, other report, or computer files and listings; using, during any academic exercise, material and/or devices not authorized by the person in charge of the test; collaborating with or seeking aid from another student during a test or laboratory without permission; knowingly using, buying, selling, stealing, transporting, or soliciting in its entirety or in part, the contents of a test or other assignment unauthorized for release; substituting for another student or permitting another student to substitute for oneself. 
2.	Plagiarism: The appropriation, theft, purchase or obtaining by any means another’s work, and the unacknowledged submission or incorporation of that work as one’s own offered for credit. Appropriation includes the quoting or paraphrasing of another’s work without giving credit.  
3.	Collusion: The unauthorized collaboration with another in preparing work offered for credit. 

**Please note: I have no tolerance for cheating, plagiarism, or collusion. Any cases of purposeful academic misconduct will be punished to the greatest extent possible, no exceptions. Any case of plagiarism (intentional or not) will receive a zero, and depending on the situation, will be escalated to the appropriate academic offices.**

## Assessment Overview

| Assignment | % of Course Grade | 
| ---------- | ----------------- |
| Labs (x8)  | 40% 		 |
| Mid-Term Exam  | 20% 		 |
| Final Project  | 30% 		 |
| Participation & Preparedness  | 10% |

### Labs (40%) 
There are 8 labs, worth 5% of your final grade each.  Late labs will not be accepted. You cannot make up labs, or do extra labs.
 
### Mid-Term Exam (20%) 
There is one in-class exam. There will be a review the class before.

### Research Paper (30%)
You are required to produce a final research paper on a political science question of your choice.  Your research paper must perform at least one regression analysis, and must be a proper research paper.  With tables, this paper should be between 15-20 double spaced pages.

### Participation and Preparedness (10%)
The success of this class is largely dependent on your engaged and lively participation in it. Please come to class prepared: read the assigned readings, take careful notes, and be ready for class discussions. This grade is determined by a combination of attendance, my assessment of your engagement in class, and random pop-quizzes. 

**Attendance & Participation Expectations:** 

It is expected that you will come to course prepared, having read the course material, and ready to engage in discussion. The assigned materials should be completed before class on the date listed in the syllabus. _You should always bring your textbook to class._  Student participation is strongly encouraged through questions, informed comments, observations, etc. Attendance and participation are important to your success in this course, so I expect you to attend class every session.  A few things:
1)	Please do not e-mail me if you are going to miss a class. You are all adults with your own lives, and that means that you get to make decisions about how to use your time. 
2)	Please DO e-mail me if you are missing class for a University Approved Reason, or due to a documented family or personal emergency. You can get official documentation from your doctor or from campus life. This must get to me within a week of the missed class.
3)	Please never e-mail me after missing a class with “what did I miss?” This is not my responsibility, it is yours.  
4)	Attendance grades, pop quizzes and labs cannot be made up, unless missed due to a valid (see (2) above) reason.

**Extra Credit:** Nope.


**Final Grade Calculation: (grades .5 or above rounded up)**
| Grade | Points | Grade | Points | Grade | Points | Grade | Points | Grade | Points | 
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| A   |	85 – 100% | B+ | 75 – 79% | C+ | 60 – 64% | D+	| 67 – 69% | F |0 – 59% |
| A - |	80 – 84%  | B  | 70 – 74% | C  | 73 – 76% | D   | 63 – 66% | |		
|     |           | B- | 65 – 69% | C- | 70 – 72% | D-  | 60 – 62% | |		


**I _really_ need an A in this class:**

That’s great! I’d love for you to get an A in this class! This class is very difficult, but it’s not impossible to get an A. 

Here’s how you do it:
1)	Come to class! Listen, take notes, pay attention, engage with the material. Ask questions, struggle to figure things out.
2)	Do the reading!  Do it twice if you need to.  Review your notes, find an effective way for you to understand the material and remember it
3)	Go to the labs! Do the labs, practice using these concepts in different situations
4)	Talk to me! I am a resource! Come to my office hours, e-mail me, harass me on campus, ask me questions in class, question things that aren’t clear or that you don’t get.
5)	~Come to me at the end of the term when you have a C and beg for an A because you tried really hard and if you don’t get an A, you won’t be able to go to law school.~
